## AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard ##
AdventureWorks Database is a Microsoft product sample for an online transaction processing(OLTP) database. The AdventureWorks database supports a fictitious, multinational manufacturing company called Adventure Works Cycles. Containing more than 65 tables, this database is categorized in Sales, Purchasing, Production, Human Resources and Person datasets.

The aim of this project was to design a dashboard for the sales team and for this purpose, 5 tables from Sales and Production datasets are joined together in order to build a console that would provide live insights on sales KPI and metrics in a responsive and comprehensive way. 

The AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of sales data across multiple metrics, including monthly and quarterly revenue trends, unique customer counts, average sold product values, and order counts. It also breaks down sales performance by region (North America, Europe, and the Pacific) and showcases the top-selling products in each region, along with shipping destinations and cumulative discounts. Additionally, it includes key performance indicators (KPIs) like quarter-to-date (QTD), month-to-date (MTD), and year-to-date (YTD) revenue and order count changes, allowing users to track performance over time.

This dashboard is beneficial for sales and regional managers, executives, and marketing analysts. Sales managers can use it to assess performance trends, identify high-demand products, and compare revenue growth across regions. Regional managers can analyze the popularity of specific products within their areas, which is useful for inventory planning and targeted promotions. Executives can quickly gauge overall sales health with the KPIs, and marketing analysts may leverage the insights to refine regional marketing strategies and pricing discounts. The interactive nature of the dashboard, particularly in Looker Studio, allows stakeholders to filter and customize views, facilitating data-driven decision-making at multiple organizational levels.
