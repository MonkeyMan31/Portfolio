**Executive Summary**

This report outlines a consultancy project for the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) focused on analysing arrival flight delays at public airports across the United States. The analysis encompasses data from American domestic flights spanning June 2003 to December 2023. The DOT seeks insights on the following issues:

Avoidable Delays: Caused by on-ground and aviation operations, or air traffic control.
Unavoidable Delays: Caused by harsh weather conditions or security reasons.
Flight Cancellations: Distribution, rate, and patterns based on season, regions, and states.

In addition to passenger security, the DOT is concerned with the financial and temporal impacts of delays and cancellations in the aviation industry. In 2023, one in five flights were delayed due to avoidable or unavoidable reasons. These delays can cause passengers to miss connecting flights or accommodation reservations, placing additional strain on the National Aviation System to maintain the schedule. A reduction of even 10% in flight delays could save over $2 billion and 40,000 hours, significantly enhancing passenger satisfaction. This analysis aims to identify opportunities to minimise these effects.

The approach involves analysing general categories of delay, distinguishing between avoidable and unavoidable delays, and considering the roles of airlines and airports. This includes a historical review and examination of delay ratios for arrival flights, delay duration per delayed arrival, and the causes of delays. Pareto charts are used to identify the most influential elements in the avoidable delay category, such as airlines responsible for 80% of domestic flights and states hosting the highest number of airports, to address NAS-induced delays. Seasonal trends for weather and security-related delays are also examined to anticipate future occurrences.

Key airport characteristics evaluated include elevation, area, and number of runways. Conclusive results were derived from the type of airports (international, regional, and domestic), age of facilities, and total number of incoming flights, using techniques such as A/B testing, scatterplots, and cohorts.

**Findings**

- The average number of yearly flights decreased slightly from 2003 to 2023, but the median delay duration per delayed flight and per total arrivals increased by 31% and 37%, respectively.
- 19.2% of total arrivals were delayed, with avoidable delays accounting for 96% of these. Late aircraft had the highest share at 35.8%.
- June, July, and December had the highest delay rates due to increased holiday travel and seasonal weather conditions.
- Southwest Airlines had the highest number of total delays by airline (17.8%) and by late aircraft (25.8%), but their delay rate was just below the average.
- California experienced the highest number of NAS delays (10.9%), attributable to its high number of airports (34).
- Airports established after 2000 showed better results in avoidable delay rates (15.59% compared to 18.46%) but higher average delay duration per delayed flight.

A digital dashboard with filter options has been created to facilitate further exploration of the data.
