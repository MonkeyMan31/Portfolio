**Project Summary**

Olist is a Brazilian marketplace that operates in the e-commerce segment, but is not an e-commerce service itself. It operates as a SaaS (Software as a Service) technology company since 2015. It offers a marketplace solution to shopkeepers of all sizes to increase their sales whether they have online presence or not.

Olist’s solution consists of three aspects: Software, Contracts with the main marketplaces and Reputation sharing. Olist describes the whole process as follows:

Olist is a large department store within marketplaces which is connected to the main e-commerces of Brazil. It does not buy products, does not keep products in stock and does not carry out shipping of any products offered in its store
All products are sold and shipped by the thousands of shopkeepers who sell through Olist. The Olist's strength lies in the union of all participating shopkeepers, who are selling physical products.
The shops are responsible for separating, packing, and taking products to the logistics operator. It is quite similar to Amazon, without logistics support. 

The Olist dataset includes transactional payments and orders data from 100,000 orders spanning 2016 to 2018. This data encompasses key aspects of sales and operations, including customer, seller, and product details, order and payment information, shipment and delivery records, and product category translations from Portuguese. The dataset is organized across nine tables, detailing sales volumes, payment types, installment usage, shipping costs, and geographical data, providing a comprehensive foundation for in-depth analysis of marketplace dynamics.

Throughout this project, I conducted a series of comprehensive analyses on Olist’s transactional data, starting with timing and delivery metrics to address customer concerns about delays. I assessed order approval and delivery intervals, revealing that delivery times were improving while approval times showed occasional spikes. This suggested that issues could be related to the order approval process. I further explored the gap between estimated and actual delivery times, identifying that merchants set conservative estimates, which could impact customer expectations and satisfaction.

I examined payment methods to determine popularity among customers, with a focus on installment payments. This included analyzing payment frequency and average transaction values, uncovering trends like the high popularity of 8- and 10-installment plans. Additionally, I conducted a geographical analysis of freight costs by region, highlighting potential competitive advantages for southeast sellers with lower shipping costs. Finally, using Benford's Law, I checked for anomalies that could indicate fraud, and I confirmed the applicability of the Pareto Principle in sales distribution, identifying high-revenue product categories to guide business strategy.
